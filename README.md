# VirtualRadiologyData
Pre- and Post-Processing for radiological data

## Project Virtual Radiology
We implement and evaluate XR-applications in the Radiology workflow. This repository is used for Pre- and Post-Processing, mainly of DICOM-data. 
There is another repository names VirtualRadiology. There we maintain our VR-application build using Unity.
